#!/usr/bin/env bash
# verify-backup.sh — Restore the latest backup to a temporary verification
# database and run data-integrity checks, so a corrupted or incomplete
# backup is caught proactively instead of only being discovered during an
# actual disaster.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-backup.sh [--type daily|weekly|monthly] [--keep]
#
# Required env:
#   DATABASE_URL         — PostgreSQL connection string for the PRODUCTION
#                           database (used only for read-only row-count /
#                           comparison queries, never written to)
#   VERIFY_DATABASE_URL  — PostgreSQL connection string whose *database name*
#                           is a scratch database this script creates,
#                           restores into, and drops. Must point at the same
#                           server/role as DATABASE_URL, differing only in
#                           dbname (e.g. same as DATABASE_URL with
#                           `/grayfix` replaced by `/backup_verify`).
#   S3_BUCKET            — S3 bucket backups are stored in (passed through
#                           to db-restore.sh)
#
# Optional env:
#   GPG_RECIPIENT, S3_ENDPOINT, S3_PREFIX — passed through to db-restore.sh
#   --keep                — do not drop the verification database on exit
#                           (useful for manually inspecting a failure)
#
# Exit code 0 only if every check below passes. On any failure, the
# verification database is left in place (even without --keep) so the
# failure can be inspected before the next scheduled run overwrites it.
