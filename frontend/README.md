# 🌾 Grayfix Frontend

The official Next.js web application for **Grayfix**, a decentralized escrow protocol designed to secure agricultural trade across different regions.

Grayfix eliminates the "Trust Gap" between buyers and sellers using Soroban Smart Contracts on the Stellar network, ensuring fair trade even when parties are hundreds of miles apart.

## About Grayfix

**Grayfix** provides a programmable safety net for regional commodity trading:

- **Smart Escrow**: Secure funds holding using cNGN/stablecoins on the Stellar network
- **Dynamic Loss Sharing**: Negotiable risk-sharing ratios (e.g., 50/50, 70/30) for handling transit accidents
- **Proof-of-Delivery (PoD)**: Mandatory video-based verification involving buyer and driver
- **Automated Settlement**: Flat 1% platform fee deducted upon successful trade completion
- **Volatility Protection**: Stellar Path Payments allow users to pay in local currency (NGN) while locking value in cNGN
